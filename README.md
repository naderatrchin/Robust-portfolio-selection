# Robust-portfolio-selection
Distributionally robust mean variance portfolio selection with wasserstein distances

input:
historical monthly closing price for stocks (ever being)in S&P500 from 1990 to 2018
S&P500 monthly price (just for comparison to be used as a benchmark in plots)


for stocks to be used, they have to be in S&P from 1990 till 2000, and we stick to these stocks till the end
